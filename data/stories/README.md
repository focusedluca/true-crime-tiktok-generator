# Story Files

This directory contains the true crime stories used to generate scripts.

## Files:
- `example_stories.txt` - Sample stories for testing and demonstration
- Add your own story files following the same format

## Format:
Each story should be formatted as:
```
{number}. **{Title}**:
   {Brief description in 1-2 sentences}
```

## Example:
```
1. **The Zodiac Killer**:
   A serial killer terrorized San Francisco in the 1960s and 1970s, leaving cryptic messages and was never caught.

2. **The Black Dahlia Murder**:
   Elizabeth Short was found brutally murdered in Los Angeles in 1947. Her body was grotesquely mutilated and the killer remained unknown.
```

## Guidelines:
- Keep descriptions brief (1-2 sentences maximum)
- Use factual, respectful language
- Separate each story with a double line break
- Focus on well-known cases that are in the public domain
- Ensure stories are appropriate and not overly graphic

## Usage:
- The system reads stories sequentially by number
- You can create multiple story files for different categories
- Update the script generator to point to your preferred story file
